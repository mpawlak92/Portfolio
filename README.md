The application was prepared as portfolio for developers. It is
responsive SPA, that shows information about developer, his projects,
and allows the ability to contact them. After logging in, it gives you the
ability to edit all the developer's information and ther projects. I also
created Rest API for this project because I needed it although I do not
aspire for full stac developer for now, so do not judge it please.
